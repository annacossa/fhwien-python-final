## Hangman Game
Our hangman game consists of an English-German dictionary where the word pairs are simultaneously guessed.   
We decided to split our implementation into several working packages: 
- Package 1: Intro text + user name input
- Package 2: Creation of an English-German dictionary as word list (extra .py file) 
- Package 3: Hangman design with ascii (extra .py file)
- Package 4: Selection of random word pair from word list, display masked letters with underline character
 - Package 5: Guessing game with loosing lives. No life is lost when the same letter is entered again
 - Package 6: Integration and testing
